# Security
The tax and distribution is all built into the core smart contract, and we have utilised/changed already tested and proven code, so security risk is greatly minimised. The contract will be audited prior to launch.

The only external contract that is interacted with is the IterableMapping interface, which allows holders to be mapped and have HEC rewards distributed automatically.
