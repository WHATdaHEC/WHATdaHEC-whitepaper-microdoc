## Bonus steps for staking HEC 
1. Head to https://app.hector.finance/#/dashboard
2. Ensure you are on the FTM network within metamask 
3. Once on the dashboard you can head to the staking section, for a first time user you will need to approve the staking contract, once you have done that you may select how much HEC you would like to stake and approve the contract to stake your HEC tokens.
4. On top of receiving the HECflections, you can also buy more HEC directly, you can follow the links within the dashboard to find out how to buy HEC, essentially adding to your HEC reservers and increasing your stake.
