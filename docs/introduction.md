<h1>Welcome to What the HEC!</h1>
<h2>-  Generating Degenerational Wealth !</h2>

<p>Here at What the HEC! we are big believers of Defi 2.0 and Hector DAO - We strongly believe the evolution of Defi has brought us to this point. Protocol owned liquidity (POL) + the financial product of purchasable bonds allows these projects to survive the test of time and in time will become the banks of crypto, owned by the people FOR the people. We are also very bullish and have no doubt the Fantom ecosystem will continue to thirve and attract more DeFi Enthusiests, the low gas fees combined with the speed and ease of use makes for a smooth DeFi experience for the user.</p>

<p>We consider Hector DAO to be the most innovating DAO and algorithmic stable coin offered on Fantom right now, they have continued to grow at a parabolic pace, we are keen to see what the future holds and are here to support them every step of the way.</p>
